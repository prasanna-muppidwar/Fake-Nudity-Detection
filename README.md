The Fake Nude Detection System is a machine learning-based project that utilizes advanced image analysis techniques to classify images and generate nudity reports. This system allows users to upload images from their PCs or provide image URLs for analysis. Additionally, it offers a unique feature that enables users to search for images on Instagram using keywords or usernames, and then assess whether these images contain fake or explicit content.

## Overview

In today's digital age, the proliferation of explicit and fake images poses serious concerns. The Fake Nude Detection System aims to address these issues by offering a reliable solution to detect and report potentially explicit or manipulated images. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this system analyzes images and provides insights into their content, helping users make informed decisions about the images they encounter.

## Features

### 1. Image Classification
- Upload images from your PC to determine whether they contain explicit content or have been manipulated.

### 2. URL Analysis
- Analyze images hosted on external websites by providing their URLs.

### 3. Instagram Image Search
- Search for images on Instagram using keywords or usernames.
- Retrieve images associated with a specific hashtag or user profile.

### 4. Nudity Report
- Receive a comprehensive report on the content of analyzed images.
- Determine whether an image contains nudity or is potentially fake.
- Get the URL of each image for reference.
